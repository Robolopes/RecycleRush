 *
 *  @section Introduction
 *
 *  Welcome to Team 973's "The Boss" robot documentation!
 *
 *  The Boss runs on a basic state machine (implemented by the State class and
 *  the BossRobot class), and a slew of supporting subsystems (like the
 *  DriveSystem and the KickerSystem).  If you're trying to get up to speed on
 *  the main structure, check there first.
 *
 *  The source also includes a few utility classes, like ConfigParser and Flag.
 *  They aren't strictly necessary, but make things easier to code.  You'll see
 *  them used in many places in the source code.
 *
 *  @section Main Features
 *
 *  - Simple state-based architecture
 *  - User-customizable configuration
 *  - Operator configuration mode
 *  - PID-based drive compensation
